# Task Plan: [Brief Description]
<!--
  WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task. Think of it as your "working memory on disk."
  WHY: After 50+ tool calls, your original goals can get forgotten. This file keeps them fresh.
  WHEN: Create this FIRST, before starting any work. Update after each phase completes.
-->

## Goal
<!--
  WHAT: One clear sentence describing what you're trying to achieve.
  WHY: This is your north star. Re-reading this keeps you focused on the end state.
  EXAMPLE: "Create a Python CLI todo app with add, list, and delete functionality."
-->
[One sentence describing the end state]

## Current Phase
<!--
  WHAT: Which phase you're currently working on (e.g., "Phase 1", "Phase 3").
  WHY: Quick reference for where you are in the task. Update this as you progress.
-->
Phase 1

## Phases
<!--
  WHAT: Break your task into 3-7 logical phases. Each phase should be completable.
  WHY: Breaking work into phases prevents overwhelm and makes progress visible.
  WHEN: Update status after completing each phase: pending → in_progress → complete
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
<!--
  WHAT: Understand what needs to be done and gather initial information.
  WHY: Starting without understanding leads to wasted effort. This phase prevents that.
-->
- [ ] Understand user intent
- [ ] Identify constraints and requirements
- [ ] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** in_progress
<!--
  STATUS VALUES:
  - pending: Not started yet
  - in_progress: Currently working on this
  - complete: Finished this phase
-->

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
<!--
  WHAT: Decide how you'll approach the problem and what structure you'll use.
  WHY: Good planning prevents rework. Document decisions so you remember why you chose them.
-->
- [ ] Define technical approach
- [ ] Create project structure if needed
- [ ] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 3: Implementation
<!--
  WHAT: Actually build/create/write the solution.
  WHY: This is the main work phase. Keep focused on the plan.
-->
- [ ] Execute the plan step by step
- [ ] Write to files BEFORE executing (preserves context)
- [ ] Update progress.md after each significant action
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
<!--
  WHAT: Verify that your solution meets the requirements.
  WHY: Testing catches bugs and ensures requirements are met.
-->
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Document test results in progress.md
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 5: Delivery
<!--
  WHAT: Final review and delivery to the user.
  WHY: Wrap up the task cleanly and ensure user gets what they asked for.
-->
- [ ] Review all outputs
- [ ] Clean up temporary files
- [ ] Deliver results to user
- **Status:** pending

## Key Questions
<!--
  WHAT: Open questions you need to answer to complete this task.
  WHY: Tracking questions prevents them from being forgotten.
  WHEN: Add questions as they arise during the task.
-->
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

## Decisions Made
<!--
  WHAT: Architecture and implementation choices with reasoning.
  WHY: You'll forget why you chose a particular approach. This preserves that knowledge.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant decision.
-->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| [Decision 1] | [Why this choice?] |
| [Decision 2] | [Why this choice?] |

## Errors Encountered
<!--
  WHAT: Problems you ran into and how you solved them.
  WHY: Prevents repeating the same mistakes. Builds institutional knowledge.
  WHEN: Log EVERY error, no matter how small.
-->
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| [Error description] | 1 | [How you fixed it] |

## Status
<!--
  QUICK REFERENCE: Where are you in the task?
-->
**Currently in Phase 1** - [Brief description of current activity]

## Notes
<!--
  WHAT: Any other relevant information that doesn't fit elsewhere.
  WHY: Catch-all for important context.
